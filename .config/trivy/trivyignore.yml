    statement: Including sudo in the Dockerfile is essential to allow necessary administrative tasks during development within the DevContainer environment.

  - id: DS001
    path: .config/kaniko/Dockerfile
    statement: >
      The use of the 'latest' tag is intentional for this development container
      as we require continuous access to the most recent Kaniko features.
      This is acceptable in our build pipeline context where we maintain
      full control over the build environment.

  - id: DS002
    path: .config/kaniko/Dockerfile
    statement: >
      Running as root is a fundamental requirement for Kaniko's operation
      as it needs elevated privileges to perform container operations.
      This is an inherent characteristic of Kaniko's architecture and
      cannot be modified without compromising its core functionality.

  - id: DS026
    path: .config/kaniko/Dockerfile
    statement: >
      The HEALTHCHECK instruction is deliberately omitted as this is a
      build-only container that does not operate as a long-running service.
      Health checks are not applicable for containers that execute
      single-purpose build tasks and terminate upon completion.
