Feature: Project Mode Optional Integration
  As a DevSecOps engineer
  I want to generate a project with or without project mode integration
  So that I can use the DevSecOps plugin with or without custom project-specific tasks

  @default
  Scenario: Generate project without project mode integration (default behaviour)
    Given a clean temporary directory for project mode tests
    When the copier command is executed with default settings for project mode
    Then the project mode "project" directory should NOT exist
    And the project mode "project/Taskfile.yml" file should NOT exist
    And the root Taskfile should NOT include the project taskfile reference
    And the following DevSecOps Taskfiles should NOT call any project tasks:
      | phase    |
      | plan     |
      | code     |
      | build    |
      | test     |
      | release  |
      | deploy   |
      | operate  |
      | monitor  |
      | feedback |

  Scenario: Generate project with project mode integration
    Given a clean temporary directory for project mode tests
    When the copier command is executed with project mode enabled
    Then the project mode "project" directory should exist
    And the project mode "project/Taskfile.yml" file should exist
    And the root Taskfile should include the project taskfile reference
    And the following DevSecOps Taskfiles should call the project tasks:
      | phase    |
      | plan     |
      | code     |
      | build    |
      | test     |
      | release  |
      | deploy   |
      | operate  |
      | monitor  |
      | feedback |

  Scenario: Update project from project mode enabled to disabled
    Given a clean temporary directory for project mode tests
    And a project was generated with project mode enabled
    When the project is updated with project mode disabled
    Then the project mode "project" directory should exist
    And the project mode "project/Taskfile.yml" file should NOT exist
    And the root Taskfile should NOT include the project taskfile reference
    And the following DevSecOps Taskfiles should NOT call any project tasks:
      | phase    |
      | plan     |
      | code     |
      | build    |
      | test     |
      | release  |
      | deploy   |
      | operate  |
      | monitor  |
      | feedback |

  Scenario: Update project from project mode disabled to enabled
    Given a clean temporary directory for project mode tests
    And a project was generated with project mode disabled
    When the project is updated with project mode enabled
    Then the project mode "project" directory should exist
    And the project mode "project/Taskfile.yml" file should exist
    And the root Taskfile should include the project taskfile reference
    And the following DevSecOps Taskfiles should call the project tasks:
      | phase    |
      | plan     |
      | code     |
      | build    |
      | test     |
      | release  |
      | deploy   |
      | operate  |
      | monitor  |
      | feedback |
