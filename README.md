## About

The DevSecOps Plugin is a comprehensive toolset designed to streamline and enforce DevSecOps practices in your development workflow. It integrates various tools and best practices for continuous integration, security scanning, code quality analysis, and deployment automation.

The plugin follows the complete DevSecOps lifecycle:

1. 🎯 **Plan**: Initial planning and setup
2. 💻 **Code**: Code development with integrated security checks
3. 🏗️ **Build**: Automated building with security considerations
4. 🧪 **Test**: Comprehensive testing including security testing
5. 📦 **Release**: Secure release management
6. 🚀 **Deploy**: Automated and secure deployment
7. 🔄 **Operate**: Operational management
8. 📊 **Monitor**: Continuous monitoring
9. 💭 **Feedback**: Continuous improvement

### Built With

- [Task](https://taskfile.dev) - Task runner & build tool
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) - Containerization
- [MegaLinter](https://megalinter.io/) - Code quality & security scanning
- [Commitizen](https://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) - Commit message standardization
- [Lizard](https://github.com/terryyin/lizard) - Code complexity analysis
- [Grype](https://github.com/anchore/grype) - Vulnerability scanning
- [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) - Security scanner

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Task (Taskfile)
- Git
- Node.js (optional, for certain tasks)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Set up the development environment:
```bash
task dev:setup-environment
```

This will:
- Install necessary dependencies
- Configure Docker
- Set up Node.js and Bun
- Initialize the development environment

## Usage

The plugin provides a comprehensive set of tasks that can be executed using the Task runner:

```bash
# Run the complete DevSecOps pipeline
task

# Run individual stages
task plan
task code
task build
task test
task release
task deploy
task operate
task monitor
task feedback

# Run specific tools
task megalinter     # Run code quality & security checks
task commitizen     # Manage commit messages
task docker:test    # Run Docker-related tests
```

## Architecture

The plugin is organized into a modular structure:

```
.
├── .config/              # Configuration files for all tools
│   ├── bun/             # Bun runtime configuration
│   ├── commitizen/      # Commit message configuration
│   ├── docker/          # Docker configuration & scripts
│   ├── megalinter/      # Linting configuration
│   └── ...
├── .devcontainer/       # Development container configuration
└── Taskfile.yml         # Main task definitions
```

## Features

- 🔒 **Security-First**: Integrated security scanning at every stage
- 🔄 **Automation**: Automated workflows for common DevSecOps tasks
- 📊 **Quality Assurance**: Comprehensive code quality checks
- 🐳 **Container-Ready**: Full Docker integration
